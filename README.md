A layer of abstraction between a web socket server and a game module to provide reusable functionality, like detecting websocket support for the specific websocket server being used, a lobby for joining people to games, a game message broadcaster, a timer, and a handler for broken websocket connections.

This project doesn't provide any of the above yet.
